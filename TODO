# Major tasks
 0. More criterions
 1. Better tactics.
 2. Strategy / adaptation
 3. Real objects

## Definition
  Compare with classic.
  Physics.

## Object + criterion properties.
 * parameter ranges
 * criterion range
 * time based values
 * disturbance: inner, external, (T).
 * q(p) complexity
 * q reaction to q(T) shift

### Information

### Better names for methods.
 * Number of dimensions:
 * Number models total/per dimension.
 * Models per agent.
 * Quality function name.
 * Agent tactics name.
 * Adaptation + combine name.

Compare methods: mp5 with u2, x2, genetic ...

### Criterions:
  Use Sprott A to check x,vy measure methods. -- GOOD.
  Lorenz - Good,
  Rossler - near to good (pulses),
  Colpitts - good,

# Real:
  Colpitts:
    - need better BJT model;
    - PCB;
    - oscill or my probe;
    - criterion hardware realization
  Friction: printer based
  Tank: gyro, accel, compass + external.
  Vibration - acoustics stand
  Requirements: my probe, interface (HID-alike, joystick, some existent)
